  <section>
    <h2>What is Gofer, and Why Do We Use It?</h2>
    <p>
      Gofer is a programming language used for learning programming and mathematics. It’s a
      <strong>dialect of Haskell</strong>, which focuses on <em>functional programming</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Functional programming is a way to describe <strong>what to do</strong> instead of writing step-by-step
      instructions. Gofer uses
      <strong>immutable values</strong>, meaning once a value is assigned, it cannot change.
    </p>

    <h2>Gofer's Unique Features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>No Variables:</strong> Gofer doesn’t use traditional variables. Instead, it uses <code>=</code> for
        definitions, making all values unchangeable.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Good for Equational Reasoning:</strong> Gofer simplifies math-like problem-solving.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How Does Gofer Work?</h2>
    <p>
      Think of Gofer as a super-smart calculator. It solves math problems and runs scripts to handle complex tasks. The
      main components are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>The Prelude:</strong> Predefined tools and functions that are always available.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Your Scripts:</strong> Custom programs written by you for specific tasks.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps to Install and Run Gofer</h2>
    <div>
      <h3>Step 1: Download the Platform</h3>
      <p>
        Get the Gofer platform from a zip file or a shared folder. Extract or download the files to a convenient
        location like the desktop.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Step 2: Running Gofer</h3>
      <p>
        For <strong>Windows</strong>, double-click <code>gofer32.exe</code> to start the interpreter.
      </p>
      <p>
        For <strong>Linux</strong>, use the terminal to navigate to the Gofer folder and execute the command
        <code>./gofer</code>.
      </p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Testing Gofer</h2>
    <p>
      Open the Gofer interpreter and type <code>2 + 2</code>. If it responds with <code>4:Int</code>, your installation
      is successful!
    </p>

    <h2>Working with Scripts</h2>
    <p>
      A <strong>script</strong> is a program you create to solve specific problems. Save scripts with the extension
      <code>.gs</code> and load them into the interpreter using the command:
    </p>
    <code>:load myprogram.gs</code>
    <p>
      To create scripts:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use <strong>Notepad</strong> or <strong>Notepad++</strong> on Windows.</li>
      <li>Use <strong>gedit</strong> or another text editor on Linux.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Improving Visibility (Windows Only)</h2>
    <p>
      Change the font in the Command-Line Interface by right-clicking its border, selecting <code>Properties</code>, and
      adjusting the font size under the <code>Font</code> tab.
